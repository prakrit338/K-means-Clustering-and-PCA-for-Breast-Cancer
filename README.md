# K-means-Clustering-and-PCA-for-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
The code performs K-means clustering on breast cancer data, evaluates its performance, determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and visualizes the clusters in 2D using PCA. The evaluation metrics provide insights into how well the clustering captures patterns in the data.
